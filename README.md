# Cocktail Recipes

## Intro
This web app lets users search for cocktail recipes (ingredients required and instructions) by name or by a specific ingredient. Upon searching for a cocktail by name, the website will return a list of cocktails that matches the name of the cocktail searched. If searched by ingredient, the website will return a list of cocktails that requires said ingredient.

## How to use
Upon loading of the web app, the user is presented with the default page that has two sections (a top section and a bottom section).The top section has two buttons that enables the user to toggle between searching for a cocktail by name or by ingredient. The bottom section consists of the search input field and the results display section.</br>

After searching for a cocktailn name or ingredient, the bottom section will return a list of cocktails (just name and image). The user will then need to click on the image to open up a modal which will display the ingredients, the ingredients measurement, and the instructions.

## Development
Only a few features/functionality are required in this project. A search input field, ability to toggle between 2 mode of search, modals w info (when images clicked), and buttons.</br>

With that established, a rough wireframe and app hierarchy was produced with a few iterations along the way. </br>

The final app hierarchy looks like this:
